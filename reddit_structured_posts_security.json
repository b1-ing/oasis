I need a recommendation for a DVR using a few Trackmix wifi to record 27/4 (i use people/car detection on SD right now) with possible expansion for POE in the future. Also does the Trackmix wifi run POE on it’s ethernet port? Jw. Last, i think not but asking. Do they make one that connects over wifi to router? It would help with cabling restrictions at this time. Thanks"

Due to the facility layout having multiple buildings we have four cameras in another building and those four cameras are connected via fiber back to the NVR and plugged into switchport 16 on the rear 16 port PoE switch of the NVR. However, for some reason the NVR does not seem to 'like' a 2nd switch where multiple cameras are residing on one interface, I've seen this before at another site too where multiple cameras shared one interface. Sometimes one or two cameras will disappear and then reappear, sometimes they all disappear. The connection is via two Cisco switches on a GB fiber connection via Cisco SFP's. Cisco switches show no port errors, no connection drops, nothing abnormal on the line between the buildings."

When this happens my phone and laptop will have issues getting back into the cloud account as well. I have raised multiple support tickets and have gotten nowhere with support. The last one was to update to the latest version which has been done on all the sites but then again tonight it timed out again. It also seems to be hit and miss on whether I can just sign them right back in or I have to wait for an hour or so like tonight.

    "post_text": "I’m looking for an outdoor surveillance camera that would be good for a remote setting. No wifi is available on this site and neither is electricity so I think a solar/cellular camera may be the best fit for this kind of application. Please advise if you have another suggestion. I know of Reolink and have installed a couple previously but their PIR motion detection isn’t the best and their night vision is worse. What other brands or models of cameras would you recommend for this kind of application? Requirements: Reasonably priced Solar powered Cellular based Decent night vision and motion detection."

    "post_text": "Alright, I think this is the right place to ask this? I'm trying to find a basic camera to monitor my barn. I don't need any audio features, absolutely don't want to deal with a subscription, don't really need it to record anything. I just need to be able to look in frequently to check on them without walking out there at all hours, especially when I have girls expecting babies. Night vision would be important but motion detection is not, the animals would set it off every few minutes and that seems silly. It would be technically indoors (the barn is a concrete block building but it does have little screened vents at the top and bottom of two walls) so it won't get wet but it could get cold (just above freezing at the lowest). There is power out there in the form of a regular outlet (I run ac and fans in the summer) so I'd prefer a wired camera. The wifi does just about reach I believe but doing high demand things like video calls in there has had some crunchiness. I imagine that if its just sending video out, no audio, and not receiving anything back it should work? I'd look into cellular but I have a feeling that would be more expensive and I'm on a tighter budget with this."

We're planning to install them at our family cabin so everyone can keep an eye on the place when we’re not there—mainly to monitor the garden, lake area, and any animals that might be getting into things. I was wondering if there’s any way to set the cameras up so I can give people a link to view the feed, without requiring everyone to download the Tapo app. Ideally, I’d like it to be “public” in the sense that it's easily accessible (like via a URL), but still —not just anyone with the link. If that’s not possible, is there at least a way for multiple people to have their own Tapo accounts and log in to view the cameras and or get notifications? Just looking for the simplest way to share access with family without making it a hassle. Thanks!"

We can buy a smart TV and weatherproof camera but are at a loss on what to get and how to actually set it up. None of us are very tech savvy, we just want a way to watch our bees!

Basically, is there a system that let's me connect the cameras to a non-internet wifi network (basically a router with no-modem) and transfer footage to an offline central storage hub that way (like an computer or harddrive also on the network) Would a normal wifi-camera set up allow me to do that? Sorry if the question doesn't quite make sense. Im just not familiar enough with the industry to know what terminology to even look for. I've been hesitant to look at home secuirty systems because I don't like the idea of someone potentially being able to get into my home Internet wifi, and access the system from the internet (yes, I'm paranoid)."

Right before I go to sleep I check my notifications and it says motion detected and I immediately start shaking while trying to open the app. Then the app just doesn’t work!🥲 it won’t show me the live feed just keeps buffering on a frozen image of downstairs. Granted it does say expired but I didn’t think I had to have a plan. It’s boykeep from Amazon super cheap it’s also sitting on the floor so if someone could tell me it was most likely a bug that would be appreciated because I’m paralyzed with fear locked in my room for the last hour when I should be sleeping. I locked all doors like always and keep my porch light on. I hate being alone, I miss my foster. Someone please tell me I’m overreacting and to go to sleep. Thanks."
