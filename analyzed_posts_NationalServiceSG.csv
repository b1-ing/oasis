Hi everyone,
I’m currently quite stressed and confused about my NS situation and hoping someone here might have gone through something similar or can offer advice.

Here’s my situation:
	•	Enlisted into Enhanced BMT as a PES B1 recruit (combat-fit)
	•	After 5 days, I sought help from CareHub, then saw my MO, and received 3 days of Respite MC
	•	Was later sent to IMH A&amp;E, received a memo, and submitted it to my unit
	•	I was told I’ll be referred to PCC (Psychiatric Case Conference), but I’ve yet to get any confirmation on my appointment
	•	Currently, I’m:
	•	Awaiting OOC
	•	Still PES B1 (MO has not down-PESed me)
	•	On Light Duties (84 days)
	•	Excused Stay-In (temporary)
	•	Excused FLEGS
	•	Still allowed to take Respite MCs when needed

My main concern is this:
Will I be posted into a combat vocation unit before I get to see PCC or before they down-PES me?

Hi everyone,
I’m currently quite stressed and confused about my NS situation and hoping someone here might have gone through something similar or can offer advice.

Here’s my situation:
	•	Enlisted into Enhanced BMT as a PES B1 recruit (combat-fit)
	•	After 5 days, I sought help from CareHub, then saw my MO, and received 3 days of Respite MC
	•	Was later sent to IMH A&amp;E, received a memo, and submitted it to my unit
	•	I was told I’ll be referred to PCC (Psychiatric Case Conference), but I’ve yet to get any confirmation on my appointment
	•	Currently, I’m:
	•	Awaiting OOC
	•	Still PES B1 (MO has not down-PESed me)
	•	On Light Duties (84 days)
	•	Excused Stay-In (temporary)
	•	Excused FLEGS
	•	Still allowed to take Respite MCs when needed

My main concern is this:

1m3y4n1,Signing on to C4X? Worth it or not,Fred-ss,https://www.reddit.com/r/NationalServiceSG/comments/1m3y4n1/signing_on_to_c4x_worth_it_or_not/,29,15,2025-07-19T14:52:05Z,Question,"Hi guys, I have yet to enter the force (waiting to be enlisted), but I am considering signing on to C4X since signing is best done during BMT, from what I have heard. I have read posts regarding signing on but they are about 3 years ago, so I'd like to gain a newer/fresher insight on the current state.  
  
Let me list out some of my concerns regarding signing on to C4X, hopefully any ex-regulars, current regulars of C4X, or even other vocation regulars could share their experience, stories or advice regarding this decision.

Pros:  
  
1. Sign-on bonus  
  
2. University tuition is paid for fully (this to me is somewhat of a concern, because my GPA will definitely not land me in NUS (yes I tried, my GPA (Dip in CyberSec) + Certs + Personal Projects + Extra-Curricular activities + Work Experience), SIT is my only hope. So if SIT rejects me, I would have no choice but to study private/overseas uni if I want to attain a Degree. My parents specifically told me that if I were to study overseas or private, I would be paying for the fees myself.  
  
3. Decent starting pay post uni (from what I heard about $5K base/starting pay for uni graduates), and will only increase with promotions. Not sure if there is risk pay for C4X.

4. Career and Financial stability, in terms of, I won't just get fired out of nowhere. (Unless I make a serious mistake, and the fact that I can continue my position even after my bond ends)

5. C4X aligns with my career path and studies, so I would assume that with the work that I would be doing in C4X, it would minimally provide me with beneficial knowledge/experiences/skillsets that are transferrable into the private sector, be it soft-skills or hard-skills.

6. Regular pay during my 2 year mandatory service

Cons:

1. 6 year bond, so when im out of SAF, im already 32. Meaning im tied to SAF for about the next 10-12 years or so, no room for regrets

2. Heard about the toxic work culture regarding superiors and regulars, but im not sure if it is as rampant in C4X

3. Potentially thrown into some sai kang BS role, which will provide me with absolutely nothing in value

  
For some context, I don't really mind going through OCS to become occifer, if it is part of the requirement as a sign-onee then so be it.   
  
I have also worked at a private sector company before, doing cyber related work. It is just 9 hours a day x5 every week (office / WFH), I would be lying if I said that it wasn't a mixture of boring/super-stressful, I would say that (in my opinion), most of the full timers there are overworked, juggling 7 concurrent projects at once with super tight deadlines.

1m3xi25,Worried I'm losing my bf while he's in NS,Fluid_Zombie_6197,https://www.reddit.com/r/NationalServiceSG/comments/1m3xi25/worried_im_losing_my_bf_while_hes_in_ns/,46,51,2025-07-19T14:24:59Z,Discussion,"Hi everyone! For context, my bf and I started our LDR since before he started NS (I'm from a different country), and we've visited each other IRL a few times. Our relationship has been stable and healthy for the most part.

During BMT, he made a lot of effort to call and text me whenever possible and give a lot of assurance, even though his schedule was packed. During weekend book outs we could spend almost the entire time together, and I would listen to try to understand the NS workings since I myself am not from Singapore haha.

Fast forward to after BMT, he's in infantry and now spends almost 0 time with me. From my understanding he's around the same levels of busy as before, yet he spends much less time with me now. When confronted, he just told me that he has more friends and is getting along well with the sergeants, so he enjoys his time much more now with friends like ordering out and spending bookouts with them.

Thing is, he can go a full 24 hours without texting me, sometimes won't call, always saying it's past lights out by the time he's free. During weekends he spends more time going out with friends and family and doing tasks like getting a haircut or buying things he needs for NS. And whatever free time he has in between all of that goes to watching youtube or playing games. 

Usually, I wouldn't mind these things, but the change is so abrupt and sudden that it raises room for suspicion. He literally made an entire personality change within 1 week of entering infantry. Sometimes we're only spending 5 minutes per day talking to each other (text/call). And sometimes on weekends we may only spend 8 hours together (for sleep call - so we're not even talking).

I considered he may be cheating. He told me once that he was envious of his other friends who got to go out on actual dates with their gfs during bookout on night/weekend (since we can't, I'm not in SG). But he's told me he has me as his lockscreen and all his platoon and sergeants know about us dating. He's also told his parents and siblings. I also don't think he has the balls to cheat to be honest. I have access to contact his closest friends and family to ask, but haven't in case I'm just overreacting.

I'm overall just afraid that the lack of quality time may completely dwindle the relationship, especially as it is LDR where consistent communication is key. I think I myself may also start losing passion in the relationship as I spend so much more time on myself and my friends/colleagues compared to him. To me it almost feels like I have no boyfriend except for an hour a day, especially when my love language is quality time.

Any advice/opinions would be great, especially from girlies who are also dating recruits!

Edit: there are so many sickos in my DMs asking me if I wanna cheat on him. Get a grip bruhh 😭
