I\u2019ve been having a hard time adjusting to NS life. I\u2019m struggling with sleep, barely have an appetite, and generally feel weaker and more drained. I was diagnosed with depressive disorder with anxiety features by a private psychiatrist but the camp MO (I am from mono infantry) rejected the memo. I later went to saf carehub and was offered to be in Recovery Coy. However before this I was also told that downpesing might be difficult and if it goes through, I\u2019ll likely have to redo BMT at Tekong. Worse still, I might end up back in my mono unit which I really want to avoid. So my options is just completing BMT in recovery coy.

People will argue that it\u2019s the military and obviously when you sign on the dotted line you\u2019re selling your soul to the organisation but I\u2019ve also seen many people joining and thinking they would have time for things outside, but were hit with reality fast. I personally was living on so little sleep because I wanted to have time for my hobbies and family, and when someone works so much, sleep would naturally be the first thing to sacrifice.
