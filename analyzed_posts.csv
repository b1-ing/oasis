I'm trying to find a basic camera to monitor my barn. I don't need any audio features, absolutely don't want to deal with a subscription, don't really need it to record anything. I just need to be able to look in frequently to check on them without walking out there at all hours, especially when I have girls expecting babies. Night vision would be important but motion detection is not, the animals would set it off every few minutes and that seems silly. It would be technically indoors (the barn is a concrete block building but it does have little screened vents at the top and bottom of two walls) so it won't get wet but it could get cold (just above freezing at the lowest). There is power out there in the form of a regular outlet (I run ac and fans in the summer) so I'd prefer a wired camera. The wifi does just about reach I believe but doing high demand things like video calls in there has had some crunchiness. I imagine that if its just sending video out, no audio, and not receiving anything back it should work? I'd look into cellular but I have a feeling that would be more expensive and I'm on a tighter budget with this. 

I did do some looking of my own at first but all the cheap cameras seem to require subscriptions and have all sorts of extra bells and whistles that really seem like overkill in this situation. I just need to know when one of the girls goes into labor or check in when I'm off the farm just in case. Any help here would be awesome!",43,0,nonviral,"Simple live camera suggestions?.
