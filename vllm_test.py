 questionable drug addict who I don't trust at all. I also lock my door, But have 1 day a week that I'm not able to do that, and want to make sure my stuff isnt stolen or tampered 
with. I've tried looking for different type of CCTV type cameras, But almost all the ones I've seen require a whole DVR setup. I just want 1 single camera that can constantly recor
d, and save to an SD card or something similar, and to have the ability to set up my camera to wifi and check on it from my phone, or go back and watch the recording. Any recommendations?",

Airbnb has motion sensors with what looks like camera lens through the living areas, hallways etc. we've been here a few days and I didn't notice. 

Are these cameras or are they part of the motion sensor lens? Unsure - help appreciated. I've met the host and can't imagine her to do something sinister.",
